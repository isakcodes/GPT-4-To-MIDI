Looking at your chord progression, we can see some examples of dissonant chords at the following points:

(I've only identified the most relevant, there may be more)

1. Ab2-1-34, Gb3-1-34, Bb3-1-34, B3-1-34
2. D3-1/4-38, Bb3-1/4-38, F3-1/4-38, D4-1/4-38, F4-1/4-38
3. A2-1/4-39, E3-1/4-39, G3-1/4-39, C4-1/4-39
4. C3-1/2-52, Bb3-1/2-52, D4-1/2-52, E4-1/2-52

Revised melody to better fit these dissonant chords would be:

A4-1/4-0.5, C5-1/4-33.75, F4-1/4-34, Bb4-1/4-34.25, Cb4-1/4-34.75, Bb4-1/4-35, Cb4-1/4-35.25, D4-1/4-39, Bb4-1/4-39.25, C4-1/4-39.5, C5-1/4-39.75, C4-1/4-39.75, Bb3-1/4-39.875, A4-1/4-43, C5-1/4-43.25, Bb4-1/4-43.5, D5-1/4-43.75, C4-1/4-52, Eb4-1/4-52.25, D4-1/4-52.5, C5-1/4-52.75

The remainder of the melody can stay the same as it fits well with the other chords in the progression.
