Next prompt> the dissonant chords in the progression aren't complemented by this melody. Could you identify the areas where the chords are dissonant, and edit the melody to fit better (unless it already is a good fit of course)?


[*] Making request to OpenAI API

Looking at your chord progression, we can see some examples of dissonant chords at the following points:

(I've only identified the most relevant, there may be more)

1. Ab2-1-34, Gb3-1-34, Bb3-1-34, B3-1-34
2. D3-1/4-38, Bb3-1/4-38, F3-1/4-38, D4-1/4-38, F4-1/4-38
3. A2-1/4-39, E3-1/4-39, G3-1/4-39, C4-1/4-39
4. C3-1/2-52, Bb3-1/2-52, D4-1/2-52, E4-1/2-52

Revised melody to better fit these dissonant chords would be:

A4-1/4-0.5, C5-1/4-33.75, F4-1/4-34, Bb4-1/4-34.25, Cb4-1/4-34.75, Bb4-1/4-35, Cb4-1/4-35.25, D4-1/4-39, Bb4-1/4-39.25, C4-1/4-39.5, C5-1/4-39.75, C4-1/4-39.75, Bb3-1/4-39.875, A4-1/4-43, C5-1/4-43.25, Bb4-1/4-43.5, D5-1/4-43.75, C4-1/4-52, Eb4-1/4-52.25, D4-1/4-52.5, C5-1/4-52.75

The remainder of the melody can stay the same as it fits well with the other chords in the progression.

Can you see if you can identify the notes in your melody that are harmonically out of line with respect to the key? Also, in what key do you think the chord progression I gave is?


[*] Making request to OpenAI API

I see, my apologies for the oversight. The chord progression you've provided uses predominantly chords that are found within the F major key, and prominently features a F-C-Bb pattern, which is often found in F major progressions. 

However, there are definitely instances where it incorporates chords that could be seen as borrowing from other keys, such as B Major (possibly borrowed from F# major), or A Major (possibly borrowed from D minor). Including these unique chord choices, we can't definitively say the chord progression is in one key and instead it would be more accurate to consider it as modulating or changing keys throughout.

Here, I would need to adjust the melody around bar 34 (Ab2-1-34, Gb3-
